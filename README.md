## Laravel-api

Since out of the box laravel projects are not API friendly, this is a simple project I use to quickly spin up laravel API projects.

What it does:-
1. Removed 'api' namespace from api routes and added 'web' namespace for web routes.
2. Add version grouping of routes.
3. I didn't feel the need to add an auth system, but I mostly use the simple token-based authentication with [Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum).
